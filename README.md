# Ceres Full Stack Tech Screen

## Project
We have images (.png) and a file containing image metadata (.txt) stored on s3. We would like you to write a Python API that can answer the following queries:

- Get list of all images available
- Download specific image
- For a specific image, get associated metadata from the metadata file

Feel free to download these files and write the API to read from your local drive. Then, create a simple frontend to select an image and display its metadata.

## Instructions
This project should take no more than a few hours to complete. Please organize your code into a Github repository and send us the link for submission. Weâ€™ll evaluate the exercise by looking at the end result and the code.

The s3 bucket with images and metadata is located here:
